# Algorisk: A Secure and Compliant Platform for AI-Powered Risk Modeling

Welcome to the official GitHub page for **Algorisk**, an enterprise solution designed to bring clarity, compliance, and confidence to the entire model lifecycle for banks and financial institutions. Our platform leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to accelerate risk analysis, while providing a robust security framework that meets the highest standards of the financial industry.

## The Challenge: Mitigating AI Risks in Banking

While the adoption of AI offers immense opportunities, it presents significant risks if not managed properly. Many "quick-to-market" solutions overlook the critical security and compliance requirements of a highly regulated industry. This can lead to:

* **Data Leakage:** Exposure of sensitive customer PII and proprietary data.
* **Regulatory Fines:** Failure to comply with strict regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and regional banking laws.
* **Reputational Damage:** Loss of customer trust from a single security incident.
* **Operational Instability:** Unreliable model outputs and "hallucinations" that lead to flawed risk assessments.

Our mission is to provide an AI-native platform that preemptively addresses these challenges, ensuring that your data remains secure at every step.

## Our Solution: The Algorisk Shield

The Algorisk Shield is our multi-layered defense strategy, built on a **shared responsibility model** with your chosen cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure). We provide the application-level security, while the cloud platform provides the secure infrastructure.

**Key Safeguards:**

| Safeguard | Description | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Anonymization** | Automated removal or masking of all Personally Identifiable Information (PII) before model interaction. | Protects customer privacy and ensures compliance with data regulations. |
| **Tokenization** | Replacement of sensitive, non-PII data (e.g., transaction IDs, account balances) with meaningless tokens. | Prevents the LLM from ever seeing or memorizing confidential financial data. |
| **Zero Data Retention** | A stateless architecture that discards all data immediately after processing a request. | Eliminates long-term data exposure risk and guarantees data is not stored. |
| **Input & Output Filtering** | Advanced guardrails to scan and sanitize both user prompts and model-generated responses. | Mitigates prompt injection attacks and prevents the generation of sensitive outputs. |
